        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          Hi, I am Suraj Parmar, currently working as a Machine Learning
          Engineer at a medical-legal start-up in Toronto. Where I am managing
          the cloud infrastructure, building and scaling agentic document
          processing pipelines that can scales to hundreds of customers per day.
        </p>
        <p>
          Previously, I worked at a healthcare start-up, SpassMed in Toronto
          where I have worked on projects involving statistical and deep
          learning based forecasting and classification models. Built and
          deployed efficient Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) pipelines in
          completely offline environments. Published papers on the topic of
          early Sepsis detection.
        </p>
        <p>
          My master's thesis was on the topic of "Utilizing Deep Learning for
          Enhancing Performance on Encrypted Stock Market Data". The goal was to
          extract robust and meaningful representations for Numerai datasets to
          improve the GBDT baseline model. I have been researching on the
          Numerai datasets for financial data. My main focus right now is
          Transformers on cross-sectional asset prediction involving
          self-supervised learning. Can read more about it on my

          >.
        </p>
        <p>
          I previously interned at Zujo, a Computer Vision start-up in India,
          and later worked at RealAdvisor as a Data Scientist remotely.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am available for contract and freelance work. Feel free to reach out
          to me on my email or social media handles.
